These two PHP files work together to manage user interactions in a web application. The profile.php file handles the backend logic for user profiles â€” it checks login sessions, lets users update details like name, phone, bio, or user type, saves the changes to the database, and then redirects with a success message. On the other hand, the message.php file provides the frontend layout for displaying those messages or notifications, built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and FontAwesome. Together, they create a flow where profile updates are processed in the backend and the results are clearly shown to users through a styled message interface.
